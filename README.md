# Encryption-Decryption-Algorithm

üîê Encryption in cryptography is a process by which a Plaintext or a piece of information is converted into Ciphertext or text which can only be decoded by the receiver for whom the information was intended. It helps in protecting consumer information, emails and other sensitive data from unauthorized access to it as well as secures communication networks. Whereas Decryption is the process of converting "meaningless" message (Ciphertext) into its original form (Plaintext).

‚ÑπÔ∏è One of the encryption algorithms is to move each character in a message by a certain number of characters inside the alphabet. In this Python code the "key" in encryption is the number of places each character is moved in the posive direction, and the "key" in decryption is the number of places each character is moved in the negative direction.

This code allows us to give as an input not only lowercase, but also uppercase letters and numbers; so you can run this code and make interesting experiments. Wish you have fun! üß©
